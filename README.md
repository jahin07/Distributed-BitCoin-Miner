## 1. Size of Work Unit: 
We have used number of actors = (No. of cores in the machine*2)+2 for the most effective usage. Each worker gets equal of of work at every instant. The size of our work unit is determined by regulating the actors and determining the ideal distribution of subproblems for a fixed number of workers. The bitcoins are mined continuously by workers which are supervised by a boss to keep track of the process. Even as separate machines are added as workers, the work size is distributed equally. 

## 2. Results for k = 4 (first 5 results included)

## 3. Running time for k = 5 (4-core machine)

1. **real** 1m3.688s
2. **user** 2m55.792s
3. **sys**  0m45.779s
4. **Ratio of (user+sys)/real** = ~3.48

## 5. Largest Number of working machines used to run code: 4

## 6. Note: 
We have included a hack for Windows machines to make sure they pick up the correct IP address instead of locaclhost.
